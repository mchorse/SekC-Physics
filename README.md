# SekC-Physics
A mod which will add various features simulating physics inside of mc.

Potentially will support addons so not all features have to be included and other modders can make features using available resources.

Ragdolls will be generated on startup based on the mods installed. So if you are a mod author and want your mobs to work with this mod feel free to contact me or go ahead and add the data yourself if you want to.
